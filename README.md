# Sabbatical
 some stuff i want to explore, post or mid sabbatical
 
 - golang
 - KV storage as a backend
 - containers / k8s
 - deploy pipelines

## to see this project in action
```shell
cd Sabbatical/src/web/frontend
sudo docker-compose up
```
docker-compose will then either run or build all the containers needed, pretty cool
