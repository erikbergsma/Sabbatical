# Sabbatical
 some stuff i want to explore, post or mid sabbatical
  
so far:
 - CRUD API written in golang + redis as a DB
 - API frontend in angularjs (under NGINX)
 - frontend, API and DB are seperate containerized services 
 - these services are under docker-compose for running and building

## to see this project in action
```shell
cd Sabbatical/src/web/frontend
sudo docker-compose up
```
docker-compose will then either run or build all the containers needed, pretty cool
